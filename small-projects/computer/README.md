Currently only one file
[computer.py](computer.py).<br>
Will create a simple computer and
execute an example set of instructions when run as main program.

### TODO:
- [ ] Add carry flag and conditional jumps.
- [ ] Add a more realistic update system (*Clock* class).
- [ ] Add an *examples.py* file.
- [ ] Add a graphical interface to visualize the operations of the computer.
